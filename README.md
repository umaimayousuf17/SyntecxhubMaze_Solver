# SyntecxhubMaze_Solver
A Python-based AI project that implements the A* Search algorithm to find the shortest path in a 2D maze with obstacles.

# Project 1: Maze Solver using A* Search
This project is part of my AI Internship at Syntecxhub.

## Description
The goal of this project is to find the shortest path between a starting point and a goal in a grid-based maze while avoiding walls.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- A* Search Algorithm
- Heapq library
